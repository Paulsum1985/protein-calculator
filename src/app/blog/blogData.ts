        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">What is Protein and Why Do We Need It?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Protein is a fundamental macronutrient that serves as the building block of life. Made up of amino acids, protein plays crucial roles in nearly every biological process in your body. From maintaining muscle mass to supporting immune function, protein is essential for optimal health and wellness.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Key Functions of Protein in Your Body</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li class="text-gray-700">Building and repairing muscle tissue</li>
          <li class="text-gray-700">Supporting immune system function</li>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Complete vs. Incomplete Proteins</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Not all proteins are created equal. Complete proteins contain all nine essential amino acids your body needs but cannot produce on its own. Understanding the difference can help you make better dietary choices:</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">Scientific evidence shows that protein intake beyond your body's needs won't lead to extra muscle growth. The body can only utilize a certain amount of protein for muscle synthesis, with excess typically being converted to energy or stored as fat.</p>
            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-3 rounded">
              <p class="text-sm"><strong>Research says:</strong> Most people need between 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of body weight for maximum muscle growth when combined with resistance training.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">While post-exercise protein can be beneficial, the "anabolic window" is wider than previously thought. Total daily protein intake matters more than precise timing.</p>
